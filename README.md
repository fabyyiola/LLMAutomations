Welcome to `coolLLMAutomation` — a public collection of practical, time-saving automations using LLMs (like Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) to solve real-world problems in data, logistics, engineering, and beyond.

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Fabiola — a full-stack engineer, IT architect, and founder of **Flexsoft**, a logistics SaaS platform built with precision, care, and a lot of coffee.

I’ve spent over a decade building scalable systems, optimizing processes, and designing solutions that bridge the gap between business needs and clean, maintainable code.

But beyond titles, what really defines me is my **curiosity**.  
I'm deeply passionate about understanding how things work, how to make them better, and how to remove friction from everyday tasks through creative problem solving.

Whether I’m scripting a data cleaner, designing multi-tenant infrastructure, or automating legacy data migration with LLMs, I bring the same energy to every challenge:  
**figure it out, make it elegant, and make it useful.**

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

This repo is a growing collection of automation snippets, scripts, and ideas where **LLMs meet engineering**.

Each project is built to be:
- **Practical**: created to solve real use cases I've encountered in production
- **Minimal**: no bloated tools or excessive boilerplate
- **Creative**: most of them started as late-night “what if I try this?” ideas

These are not just toy demos. They’re things I’ve actually used — and I’m sharing them so others can too.

## 🔍 Why I Built This

Sometimes it’s not about building the next big app.  
Sometimes it’s about **saving 3 hours** on a dirty CSV import.  
Or avoiding manual cleanup of 1,500 customer records.  
Or generating structured data from open text without reinventing the wheel.

I believe the real power of LLMs isn’t just in the tech — it’s in how we use it to make life easier.

This repo is my contribution to that mindset.

## ❤️ Let’s Connect

If you’re into automation, logistics, AI-assisted workflows, or just clever engineering tricks — feel free to follow along, share ideas, or reach out.

I'm always open to good conversations and better ways to solve problems.

> *Thanks for stopping by — I hope this repo sparks some ideas of your own.*
